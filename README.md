# Movie_Api_Project
The goal of the project is to create a robust and user-friendly API that provides access to a comprehensive collection of movie data. 
By leveraging Django's powerful framework, we aim to deliver a seamless experience for developers and movie enthusiasts alike. 
This API will allow users to retrieve movie information, 
search for specific movies, 
rate and review movies, and perform various CRUD operations. 
With an intuitive design, efficient data storage, and thoughtful implementation of features such as authentication and pagination.
The Django API project will serve as a reliable resource for movie data integration and exploration!

At the end of the project I created Endpoints listed below:
Created an endpoint to list movies.
Created an endpoint that allows only users with “staff” status to add movies.
Created an endpoint that generates movies from an external API source. Other source (https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs)
An endpoint that allows users to search for a movie using the title, actor or category type.
I used the swagger documentation for all endpoints
